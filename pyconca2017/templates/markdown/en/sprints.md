PyCon Canada Development Sprints are two days of intensive learning and development on an open source project of your choice, in a team environment. It's a time to come together with colleagues, old and new, to share what you've learned and apply it to an open source project.

They will be held at the [UQAM Chaufferie du Pavillon Coeur des sciences](https://goo.gl/maps/SftS8JCP8DJ2), room CO-R700 (175 Avenue du Pr√©sident-Kennedy).

PyCon provides the space and infrastructure (network, power, tables & chairs); you bring your skills, humanity, and brainpower (oh! and don't forget your computer).
